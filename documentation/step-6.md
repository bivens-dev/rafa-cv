# Introduction

In this section we are going to build out the projects we want to show off so people can see both the code you wrote and 
the final result. We will also create a tags section for each project just so all of the recruiters who are scanning for 
certain keywords can find them easily.

Just like in the last section we are going to use the responsive design approach here because we want to have a different 
layout depending on how big the screen is. 

We will start by just creating the styles for these project cards on mobile phones and then we will have a section towards 
the bottom of the CSS where we have a couple of additional rules for desktop users that let us override some of the choices 
we made originally. Things like switching between a column based layout (vertical) and a row based one (horizontal). There 
are a couple of other little tweaks we make along the way but not too many.
