# Introduction
We are going to create a basic page here that is just to help ourselves out as we move through the project 
that brings together lots of the design choices we are making along the way and gives us an easy way to 
visualize them.

This idea of a standarized design system however is really common in a lot of bigger companies so there is 
a super high likelyhood that at some point you will run into something like this in real life and the way it 
works will be different but the ideas will be the same.

Putting in this extra work up front normally makes the process easier because we already started standarizing 
these choices in one place in the code and when we want to change things (for example some of the colors we 
have on the light theme don't look very good to me at the moment) we just need to change one thing in the code 
and then everywhere we have used these classes will update automatically.

## Sidenote 1
I mentioned that this page is only really for our purposes but if you get a chance to talk about this and show 
it to people in interviews I think it will really impress them just because it shows that you have given some 
thought about how to organize your code in a sensible way that is going to be easy to update later. One of the 
most common problems when it comes to coding at all levels (not just juniors) is as time goes on you keep making 
lots of little one off changes here and there and eventually it always gets to the stage where whenever you change 
one thing something else will break.

That is obviously SUPER common with juniors so again, I wanted to put this in the project to just give you another 
chance to talk through some of the design choices and considerations you made when putting this project together in 
any interviews and also to just give you an idea about "how big companies" do stuff like this in real life because 
they aren't the kind of things you would have likely come across yet and the best way to learn is by going through 
this process yourself on a personal project.

## Sidenote 2
We will keep building this out as we go along making the rest of the page and adding new styles but this is just what 
we are using at the moment and I don't yet know what the rest is going to look like.
