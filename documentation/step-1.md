# Introduction

We are going to be creating a basic 1 page "developer portfolio" website that you can send to people when 
applying for jobs. As much as possible we will try to use this instead of a regular CV / resume because 
it's going to do a much better job of showcasing your skills when you don't have professional experience 
to fall back on.

There are probably going to be a couple of things in here that you may not have seen before but the idea 
is to break things down into small steps just like the courses and introduce just a couple of new ideas 
at a time so that it's not overwhelming.

I also wanted to make sure you had lots of cool things to talk about during your interviews that will 
help demonstrate that you know what you are talking about and also give you some patterns that you can 
consider using in the future when you are building real world features.

## Feature Specification

I'm going to just outline a few features that we are going to build as we go along so you have some context 
as for what we are doing at each step.

### Dark & Light Themes

You already have some experience with CSS by this point but I wanted to show you how to think about building 
different "color themes" for a website. This is one of those things that I wanted to include because it's 
exactly the kind of thing I had in mind that you can talk about during your interviews and it's a good chance 
to demonstrate how to strcuture your CSS code without creating a huge mess later on that is hard to work with. 
I think it's also a technique you probably haven't seen so far so hopefully it's a good chance to pick up some 
new skills along the way that you can take with you.

### English & Portuguese Pages

Realistically, it's going to be helpful to have both because it will help keep your options open when it comes 
to getting a job. So we are going to build the same page twice and just swap out the languages. This is also 
going to be a good opportunity for you to follow along by creating one of them yourself so you can feel more 
comfortable with how all of the code works along the way etc.

### Responsive Design

One skill that you will need to get good at over time is figuring out how to make things look good and work correctly 
across all different kinds of devices. You already would have seen a lot of this in the courses already where there 
was a big focus on different screen sizes. We are going to do the same thing here but also see how that same logic 
can apply to other considerations too. In fact that is going to come up in this very first section where we are going 
to swap out the color themes we are building depending on if the user has set up their browser or operating system 
to indicate that they "prefer" light mode.

## About this section

In this section we are going to focus on just getting the very basic structure in place for our CSS code that will allow 
us keep things tidy and well organized as we go along. The main thing to pay attention to is how we are building out these 
different themes at the moment.
